In our project, we plan to make it easier for the user to check their syntaxes by asking them to enter a syntax and displaying an appropriate message. For loop checking, while loop checking and if statement checking has been done using JFLAP. 

The same has been coded in java using data structures such as arrays and linked lists. We have used the java.util.* package to include all the necessary packages required for this program.
